        <h2>Education History</h2>
        <p>Gradauting highschool in 2011, I joined the United States Navy soon after It was there where I started a career of medicine and health care. I would go on to do fulfill the duties as a healthcare provider for the next 5 year.
        After my enlistment, I attended college at Southwestern Community College to pursue the profession of radiology. Unfortunately, the previous path I had in mind did not fulfill my needs. Deciding what my next path should be, I
        picked up a python programming book and started teaching myself how to write code. While diving into python, I found coding enjoyable! Although I lack programming experience, I have 15+ years of computer experience that I
        have developed while previously being an avid gamer. These skills such as fast typing speed, typing accuracy,knowledge of computer hardware, knowledge of computer software, and computer navigation, all have had a direct impact on my coding performance.</p>
