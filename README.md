### Things that I learned
- Be creative using all the different kinds of loops.
- Do not forget boolean statements, I notice that I underestimate them. They are completely necessary and useful
- Tackle one part at a time and make comments so you can channel you energy into different parts of the problem rather than wasting your thinking on something you have already solved
- Failure is key! We want failure, we want struggle

### Reflection
This was definitly challenging. I handled the first few assignments fairly easy with minimal help, but this one was different.. Spent the whole day 5+ hours on trying to figure this problem out. I wouldn't say it was frustrating, it was challenging. I liked working with others and bouncing ideas off each other. I liked talking things over, breaking things down, and seeing what worked and didn't worked. I'm beginning to understand the process of handling tasks and I a liking it. As I began my coding journey, I would always get frustrated, railed up, and sweaty when I came across challenges. I learned to keep my cool and embrace the challenge!
